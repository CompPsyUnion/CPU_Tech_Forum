# About Us

The Computer Psycho Union, hereinafter referred to as CPU, is the **ONLY** student organization directly affiliated with the School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC). We are dedicated to organizing a variety of academic and social events catering to the computer science student body within the university, the school, and our association.

## The CPU Technical Forum (Tech Forum)

The CPU Technical Forum is a regular, weekly event designed to facilitate dialogue among CPU members and provide a learning platform for computer science students.

Each session features 2-3 members from the CPU technical department, senior computer science students, alumni, or industry professionals who share their knowledge and industry insights with attendees, thereby collectively honing technical skills. This event is open to all Computer Science students at UNNC, with primary participation from CPU members.

The event is conducted in both online and offline formats. Following the conclusion of each session, a recording is disseminated within the CPU community for member access. Additionally, event materials are uploaded to our GitHub repository, and a summarizing article is published on our public account for participants to review at their convenience.

## Participation as a UNNC Student

At the commencement of each academic year, we will dispatch a notification email to all undergraduate and first-year postgraduate students at UNNC. Students are invited to subscribe to invitations and review materials via the link provided in the email. The invitations will include an **external registration link**, which allows non-CPU members to register for participation.

For students from **other times/majors**, kindly direct your inquiries to [computerpsychounion@nottingham.edu.cn](mailto://computerpsychounion@nottingham.edu.cn). We will assess your eligibility to participate in our events based on the existing subscription criteria.
